But more often than not we neglect to analyze how it affects us and how we can improve it so that the process is more enjoyable and less stressfull.</p>
<p>I am a developer and I spend somewhere between 9-12 hours a day wirting, reading and understanding code, log files and comments. This post is my take on some of the common issues developers tend to ignore when working.</p>
<h4 id="Your_teminal/editor/screen_must_be_easy_on_the_eyes"><a href="#Your_teminal/editor/screen_must_be_easy_on_the_eyes" class="headerlink" title="Your teminal/editor/screen must be easy on the eyes"></a>Your teminal/editor/screen must be easy on the eyes</h4><p>Very obvious and yet I have seen very few people who actually care about it.</p>
<p>You probably look at your terminal all day, searching for text and looking through log files or writing code. The best thing you can do to your eyes is to make the task of staring into the void of your monitor a less stressful one. I don’t know of any other profession which requires someone to stare at something for hours and call it actively working.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who prefer light backgroung with black text and some others who prefer dark background with light text. Spend some time to test what works best for you and get to know what puts less stress on your eyes. It may also be that some theme would work best in the day with a lot of natural light and others may be best for the dark late night coding session. I use Solarized light during the day time and Solarized dark during the night. This may feel like nitpicking but will have positive affects in the longrun. <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized" target="_blank" rel="external">Checkout solarizd here.</a></p>
<p>Also checkut <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">flux</a>. This crossplaform application changes the colors on your monitor to suit the outside world.</p>
<h4 id="Choose_fonts_that_are_not_confusing"><a href="#Choose_fonts_that_are_not_confusing" class="headerlink" title="Choose fonts that are not confusing"></a>Choose fonts that are not confusing</h4><p>So, developing is mostly all about reading a lot of text and quickly understanding what something means. The entire process is centered around reading a lot of text. So it is a no brainer that making the text easier to read is an easy win. But most of us don’t really bother with it when we start out.</p>
<p>The fonts must be designed to make reading code easier, which is different than reading a technical document or a novel. While reading code, you will usually not bother with chapter titles or paragraphs, you will be more interested in variable names, operators, brackets and braces etc…</p>
<p>The font must not make some words (like begining of a para) seem more important. I suggest going for a monospace font as it makes all text look the same, and use a theme to color important text differently to bring them to your attention.</p>
<p>My favorite is the monoid font. It takes care of a lot of details like making l (small ell) look different than I (Big I). <a href="https://larsenwork.com/monoid/" target="_blank" rel="external">Check it out here.</a></p>
<h4 id="Remap_your_keys"><a href="#Remap_your_keys" class="headerlink" title="Remap your keys"></a>Remap your keys</h4><p>The keyboard you use to type was designed with a different use in mind. It was mostly targetted towards people who type text and not people who do special operations on the machine (like using a lot of control key and escape key in case of vim users). A lot of people prefer to remap the caps-lock key to something they actually use a lot more like the control/cmd or escape. This also means they do not have to leave the home row to use these special keys. This not only slightly improves your typing, but since you do not make that many context switches to find these special keys, you will not be as distracted as well.</p>
<h4 id="Choose_an_editor_and_become_a_professional_user"><a href="#Choose_an_editor_and_become_a_professional_user" class="headerlink" title="Choose an editor and become a professional user"></a>Choose an editor and become a professional user</h4><p>The tools make the developer. There a lot of well known editors and a lot of good options. Each editor is built around a philosophy. Learn the philosopy behind the tool and learn to make the tool work for you. Be it VIM, EMACS, Sublime or any of the other editors, learn what the people who designed sought to do with editors and learn to think on the same line and use the tool well.</p>
<p>Sublime, for example has always been the editor everyone references when multiple cursors are mentioned. It comes in handy quite a lot and when used correctly saves a lot of time and effort. Vim has its own strengths with modal editing, text objects and its plugins. Try more than one editor and pick one that suits your style but learn it well enough to be a professional user. </p>
